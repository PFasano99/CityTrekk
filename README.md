# CityTrekk

This project has been commissioned by the [Francesco De Sanctis high school](https://www.liceoclassicodesanctis.edu.it/) in Salerno for the "Erasmus+" project.  
The students created the design under my supervision and i coded the app with the design they drew.  
The app has been coded using Unity to deploy it on Android and IOS.

The app has been deployed on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.LiceoDeSanctis.CityTreKK&hl=it&gl=US) for any android device with API level 23 (Android 6.0 'marshmallow') or higher.
